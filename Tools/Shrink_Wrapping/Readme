CGAÃ‰ 3dAlphawrapping (Windows) GNU licence(free for all)
Complied the base code using Visual Studio. 

Process: 
1. cmd 
2. triangle_mesh_wrap.exe example.stl relativealpfa relativeOffset 
3. Program calulcate alpha value = diagonal dimension/relativealpha, offset = diagonal dimension/relativeOffset 
4. alpha value is roughly same size as a surface mesh size and program generates uniform mesh  

Example: 
triangle_mesh_wrap.exe  helmet.stl 500 3000 

Generally, I would like to use this program to make quick mesh for bad tesselated powertrain modules.  


Have fun!
